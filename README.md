# SSU-2022_2-StarterProject

This repository contains the three main components used in the class project, namely:

1. IoT Code: Code to run on the Raspberry Pi, which will act as an IoT device with sensors and actuators

2. Cloud Code: Code to run on the cloud servers - Kafka consumer and producer; gRPC IoT service

3. Client Code: command line gRPC clients of the IoT service

## Steps to run the demo:

### a. Start Kafka on a cloud-based server

### b. On another cloud-based server, start: cloud-based Consumer, Producer, and gRPC service

### c. On the Raspberry Pi, start the IoT-based Consumer and Producer

## Overall structure
